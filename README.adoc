Tulip is a Kotlin SDK to create load testing, stress testing, and performance regression testing benchmarks for software systems. Tulip is a robust solution for evaluating the performance and stability of web applications under varying conditions, ensuring they can handle high traffic and stress levels efficiently. Similar to well-known tools like JMeter, Gatling, and Locust, Tulip provides powerful capabilities to simulate real-world scenarios and generate comprehensive reports, helping developers identify and resolve potential bottlenecks.

See https://wfouche.github.io/Tulip-docs for more information.

== Kwrk

`kwrk` is a HTTP benchmark utility implemented using the Tulip runtime. `kwrk` is similar in functionality to https://github.com/wg/wrk[wrk] and https://github.com/giltene/wrk2[wrk2].

Show the options supported by `kwrk`:

----
$ jbang run kwrk@wfouche --help

Usage: kwrk [<options>]

Options:
  --debug=<text>
  --rate=<float>
  --qsize=<int>
  --threads=<int>
  --duration=<int>
  --iterations=<int>
  --header=<text>
  --url=<text>
  -h, --help          Show this message and exit
----

Run a low-volume, constant rate load test to `test-api.k6.io`

----
$ jbang run kwrk@wfouche \
    --rate=10.0 \
    --url=https://test-api.k6.io/public/crocodiles/1
....
....
Output filename = kwrk_output.json
Report filename = kwrk_report.html
----

The performance results are shown in `kwrk_report.html`.
The results indicate that for this particular benchmark only 1 API call failed (#F is 1)
and that the Aps (average number of actions per second) rate is 1.989 (~2.0). The number of failed operations are highlighted in $\textcolor{yellow}{yellow}$ (if it is greater than 0).
The Aps rate does not meet the target of 10.0 that was set for the benchmark and is therefore highlighted in yellow.
